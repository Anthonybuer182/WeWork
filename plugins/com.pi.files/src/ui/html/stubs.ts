/**
 * Stubs for GenOffice's `HtmlApi` (window.htmlApi).
 *
 * 51 members, of which the renderer calls a scattered handful during bootstrap —
 * none of them guessable from the outside (the first slides run died on
 * `clipboardProbe`). Each returns the SHAPE its declaration promises, so a
 * stubbed call degrades to "feature unavailable" rather than blowing up
 * somewhere far from the cause.
 *
 * Every real implementation lives in the shim next to this file, spread over
 * the top of this object.
 *
 * Generated from apps/html/src/shared/ipc.ts by scripts/gen-api-stubs.mjs. Regenerate rather
 * than edit — but do check it in: it is read far more often than written.
