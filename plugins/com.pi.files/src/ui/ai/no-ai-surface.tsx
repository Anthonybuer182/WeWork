/**
 * GenOffice's AI surface, answered by the host agent instead of theirs.
 *
 * Three vendored modules are aliased here (see `aiPanelSwap` in
 * scripts/build-panel.mjs):
 *
 *   `ai/AiPanel`     — the sidebar of docs / slides / pdf
 *   `ai/AiChatPanel` — sheets' sidebar, a *different* component
 *   `ai/transport`   — sheets only, and inert (see shims/ai-transport.ts)
 *
 * ## What this file is for
 *
 * The sidebar itself stays gone: the host already has one conversation surface,
 * and a second chat inside a document panel is the "two products stacked"
 * problem. What must NOT go with it is the *submission* path — GenOffice's
 * panels were the consumer of every AI action in these apps, so removing them
 * silently disconnected the selection popover and the ribbon presets. Those are
 * worth keeping: they carry a selection the user made on purpose.
 *
 * So this module re-implements the one thing the missing panels did that
 * mattered — and does it the way the host wants: forward the text to
 * `chat.send`, the same capability the composer uses, so an action taken here
 * behaves exactly like a message the user typed.
 *
 * ## Carrying the context the instruction is missing
 *
 * An instruction like "把选中的这句改得更正式" is not actionable on its own —
 * the agent has no document in front of it. Verified live: forwarded bare, the
 * agent answers "我看不到你选中的是哪句话" and asks for the file and the text.
 *
 * The fix needs no vendor change, because the props carry everything — each app
 * just carries it somewhere different, and none of them as a selection prop:
 *
 *   - docs gives `AiPanel` the tiptap `editor`, so this module can read exactly
 *     what the popover reads: `editor.state.selection`.
 *   - pdf gives it `api`, whose `selection()` returns the current range.
 *   - slides inlines the selected elements into the preset text it sends, ids
 *     and all, so there is nothing left to look up.
 *
 * All three also pass `filePath`, which the agent needs to open anything at all.
 *
 * The excerpt is read at submit time, and *also* cached on every commit or
 * `selectionUpdate`, because the two are not reliably the same instant: the
 * popover's own close path touches the editor and takes focus, and a submission
 * lands after that. Preferring the live value and falling back to the last
 * non-empty one means the excerpt survives either way. (The DOM selection is
 * useless here — measured empty at submit time, while ProseMirror still held the
 * range, and pdf clears its own `aiSelection` on the same collapse.)
 *
 * ## Two paths, and why both are watched
 *
 * `preset` is "立即发送": docs / slides / pdf all funnel their AI actions
 * through this one prop, each carrying a `nonce` that changes per request.
 *
 * `editQueue` is "加入队列" — and the Enter key. The queue was a *deferred*
 * batch, run later from a control in the sidebar this module removed, so with
 * the sidebar gone every queued instruction went nowhere. Forwarding on add
 * turns that dead end back into a submission, and consuming the item afterwards
 * keeps the queue's own machinery honest (see the note at the consume call).
 * docs' queue items arrive with their own `capturedText`, so there the excerpt
 * comes for free.
 *
 * sheets is on neither path: its actions go through its own `handleSend`, so it
 * gets its own watcher below.
