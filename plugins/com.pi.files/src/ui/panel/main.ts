/**
 * The file viewer panel: one page, dispatching by extension.
 *
 * The host routes every previewable extension to this plugin's FIRST panel
 * (`findPreviewHandler` returns `panels[0]`), so per-format entries have to be
 * chosen here rather than in the manifest.
 *
 * `.docx` runs GenOffice's own renderer, and so do the other document formats;
 * this dispatch chooses between those apps and the small renderers that have no
 * app behind them (plain text today, media next).
 *
 * This module also runs again after a RELOAD, which is how a format switch
 * works: a mounted renderer cannot be swapped for another app in place, so the
 * shim persists the target path and reloads, and we pick the renderer afresh.
 * See `reloadForOtherFormat` in src/ui/shims/common.ts.
