/**
 * One page per day: what was planned, what actually got done, what was missed,

 *
 * The top half is assembled entirely from data the plugin already had — no
 * input required. That is the point. A day page that opens as a blank box is a
 * page nobody opens twice; one that already lists "you finished these two
 * things" only needs a sentence added to it.
 *
 * Pure, and taking `day` as a string rather than a Date, so every boundary case
 * (an entry written at 00:30, an undated to-do finished today, a reminder that
 * came due on that day) can be pinned in a test instead of waited for.
