/**
 * When things fire.
 *
 * The whole engine is one question, asked every tick: *which firings fall in
 * `(from, to]`, and which of those did we already handle?* Everything about
 * missed runs, sleep/wake and restart recovery falls out of answering it with
 * a stored `from` instead of assuming `from = now - 30s`.
 *
 * Not firing on time is the failure mode a user notices, so the two rules that
 * protect against it get their own paragraphs:
 *
 * - **Nothing fires twice.** Every firing has a stable key, and a firing whose
 *   key is already in the run history is skipped. This is what makes it safe
 *   for a tick and a boot-time catch-up to overlap, and for a re-run to be
 *   triggered by hand.
 * - **A stale firing is recorded, not performed.** Eight hours of backlogged
 *   notifications is noise, and eight backlogged agent prompts is worse. Past
 *   the grace window a firing is written down as `missed` for the user to
 *   re-run deliberately.
